                        required
                        functionality that's why clients and other developers can easily understand what we did and how
                        to
                        change anything if necessary.

                        The goal of this software is to make smartphones and the internet more accessible for searching
                        any format of file locations with desired keyword. The purpose of the application is to easily

                        pdf ,doc and etc. from the given URLS in customized cluster. There is currently no such
                        application on the market
                        for competition. The product will be very much beneficial for reaserchers and students who are
                        willing to get some article from any url for their education and research purpose.

                        crawling from website, this should not take more than 10 hours based on the number of urls in a
                        single cluster. A notification mail will be send to user when the cluster is ready. The
                        searching will give the result within less than 5-10 seconds.</p>
